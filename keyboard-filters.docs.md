The Filter Badge Component provides a visual interface for creating, editing, and managing query filters. Users can add new filters, select columns and operators from dropdown menus, edit values through a popover interface, and remove existing filters. The component is fully keyboard accessible with proper focus management and includes responsive styling for different screen sizes.
