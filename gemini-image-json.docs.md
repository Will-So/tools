This page allows you to visualize Gemini API image generation responses by pasting JSON data from the API. The tool parses the JSON response, displays any generated images as rendered content, and shows additional metadata like usage statistics and model version. You can load an example JSON response or paste your own to see how Gemini's image generation appears.
