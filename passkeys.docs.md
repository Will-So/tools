This page provides a demonstration of WebAuthn/Passkey technology for secure authentication. Users can register a new passkey associated with a username, authenticate using a previously created passkey, and manage their credentials which are stored in the browser's localStorage. The demo includes functionality to check browser compatibility and displays debug information about authentication responses.
