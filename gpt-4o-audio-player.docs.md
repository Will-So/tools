The Gist Audio Player allows you to play and download audio from GitHub Gists containing OpenAI GPT-4o audio responses. Enter a Gist URL containing base64-encoded WAV data from the GPT-4o-audio-preview model, and the player will extract the audio, display the transcript, and provide playback controls. You can also share specific audio by using the URL parameter format `?gist=GIST_ID`.
