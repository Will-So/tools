This tool helps you explore U.S. Census data through the Census Reporter API. Search for geographical areas like cities or counties, then select data tables related to demographics, income, or other census topics. Once you've selected both a geography and at least one data table, you can retrieve and view the census data with estimates and margins of error displayed in organized tables.
