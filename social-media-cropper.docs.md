The Social Media Card Cropper allows you to create customized social media cards with correct aspect ratios for different platforms. Upload images by dropping, selecting, or pasting from clipboard, then crop and adjust your image with the interactive controls. Choose from preset aspect ratios for Twitter/LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or Substack, adjust the background color, and download your finished card in the optimal dimensions for your selected platform.
