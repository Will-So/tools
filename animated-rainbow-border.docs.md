This page displays a container with a "Rainbow Border" label and a toggle button to control animation effects. When activated, the container shows an animated rainbow-colored glowing border that pulses and changes color gradients in a continuous flow. The animation uses CSS keyframes to create a smooth transition between colors and opacity levels, giving the border a vibrant, dynamic appearance that loops infinitely until deactivated.
