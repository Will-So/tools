This tool performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDF documents and images directly in your web browser. Upload a file by dragging and dropping or clicking the dropzone, and the text content will be extracted using Tesseract.js. For PDFs, each page is processed separately and compiled into a full document, with support for multiple languages.
