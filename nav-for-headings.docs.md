This tool processes HTML content by adding unique ID attributes to all header elements (h1-h6) that don't already have them. After processing, it generates a list of anchor links pointing to each header, using the page URL you provide combined with the header IDs as fragment identifiers. The processed HTML and a formatted list of header links are displayed in separate output fields.
