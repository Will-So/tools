This tool converts images to JPEG format with adjustable quality. Users can upload an image by clicking on the drop zone or dragging and dropping a file, then adjust the JPEG compression quality using the slider. The converted image is displayed with its data URI and approximate file size, allowing users to find the optimal balance between image quality and file size.
