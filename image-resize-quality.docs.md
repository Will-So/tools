This tool allows you to compare image quality and filesize at different compression levels. Upload an image by dragging, clicking, or pasting it into the interface. The tool will display versions of your image at original and half size with various quality settings (100%, 90%, 70%, 50%, and 30%), showing file size for each variation. For transparent images, a background color picker lets you choose the fill color.
