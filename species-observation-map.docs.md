The Species observation map allows you to search for wildlife sightings around the world using data from iNaturalist. Search for a species by name, specify how far back in time to look, and view observations plotted on an interactive map with clustered markers. Each marker provides detailed information about the observation including date, location, observer name, and photos when available.
