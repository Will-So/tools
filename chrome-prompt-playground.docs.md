This playground allows you to run prompts against the Gemini Nano experimental model directly in Chrome Canary. Enter your prompt in the text area, click "Execute prompt" to see the generated response, and view your interaction history which is saved locally in your browser. The interface requires Chrome Canary with the "Prompt API for Gemini Nano" flag enabled.
