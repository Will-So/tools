This page tracks the progress of the current U.S. presidential term with a visual progress bar and statistical information. It displays days elapsed, days remaining, and the percentage of the term completed, while also tracking the time until midterm elections. The progress bar includes a marker showing when midterms occur during the presidential term, with additional statistics about the days until midterms and how far through the first half of the term we currently are.
