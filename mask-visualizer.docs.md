The Mask Visualizer is a tool for rendering JSON data containing image masks with bounding boxes in a configurable coordinate system. Users can paste JSON that includes box coordinates and base64-encoded mask images, then select one of four coordinate system origins (Top Left, Top Right, Bottom Left, or Bottom Right). The visualization displays the masks with colored bounding boxes and provides detailed coordinate information for both original and transformed coordinates.
