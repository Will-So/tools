This tool visualizes bounding box coordinates from the Gemini API on images. Upload an image, enter a prompt asking for bounding box coordinates in the format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax], and the application will display the image with color-coded bounding boxes overlaid. The canvas includes a coordinate grid system with axes labeled from 0-1000, and individual cropped sections of each detected object are displayed below the main visualization.
