This tool visualizes bounding boxes on images using the Gemini API. Upload an image, enter a prompt, and the application will display the original image with overlaid bounding boxes according to coordinates returned by the model. The coordinates use a normalized format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] on a 0-1000 scale, and cropped sections of each detected region are displayed separately below the main image.
