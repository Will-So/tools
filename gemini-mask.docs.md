This tool visualizes image segmentation masks generated by the Gemini API. Upload an image, enter your prompt (default requests object segmentation), and the system will process your request through the selected Gemini model. The visualization includes a grid overlay showing coordinates, bounding boxes around detected objects, and transparent masks highlighting segmented areas, with a comparison view showing each segmented region alongside its mask.
