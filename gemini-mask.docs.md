This tool visualizes image segmentation masks generated by the Gemini API. Upload an image, enter a prompt requesting segmentation masks, and the application will display the results with bounding boxes overlaid on your image. The extracted masks are shown side-by-side with the corresponding image regions, and a coordinate system helps you understand the normalized coordinates used in the API response.
