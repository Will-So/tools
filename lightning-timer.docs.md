The Lightning Timer is a customizable countdown application designed for time-sensitive presentations or tasks. Set your preferred duration and optional warning time through the settings gear icon. Click the timer to start, pause, or reset it. The screen changes color as time runs low, providing a visual cue when your allotted time is nearly exhausted.
