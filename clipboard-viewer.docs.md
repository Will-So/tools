The Clipboard Format Viewer displays the different data formats captured when content is pasted. It presents each format (such as text/plain, text/html, or Files) in separate sections, showing the raw content data for each format type. Paste content either into the designated area or anywhere on the page to see all the clipboard formats that were captured during the copy operation.
