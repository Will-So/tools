The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool that helps you manage work sessions using timed intervals. Enter your goal, select a duration (5-60 minutes), and track your progress with detailed session logs. The application records your session history including start/end times, durations, and any pauses, storing this data locally for future reference.
