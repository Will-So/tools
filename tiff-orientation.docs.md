This tool analyzes JPEG images to determine their TIFF orientation metadata. Upload an image by dragging and dropping or clicking to select a file, and the application will extract and display the orientation information. The tool parses the EXIF header to find the orientation tag and shows both the orientation value and a human-readable description of how the image is oriented.
