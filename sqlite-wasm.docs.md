This interactive tool allows users to query a SQLite database of pelican sightings in Half Moon Bay. The application loads a WASM-based SQLite engine in the browser and initializes a sample database with pelican observation data. Users can modify and execute SQL queries directly in the browser to explore different pelican species, locations, and sighting counts.
