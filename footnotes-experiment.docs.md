This page demonstrates an interactive footnote system that enhances content by providing additional information without disrupting reading flow. When users hover over or click a footnote marker, a popup appears with the footnote text, eliminating the need to scroll to the bottom of the page. The system includes accessibility features with proper ARIA roles and supports both desktop and mobile interactions through hover and click events.
