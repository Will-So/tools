The JSON Schema Builder allows you to create JSON schemas with a visual interface. Add properties by specifying their name, type, and whether they're required, then build nested objects and arrays. Your schema is displayed in real-time and can be copied to the clipboard with a single click. The tool also automatically saves your work in the URL, enabling you to share your schema with others.
