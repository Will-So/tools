This tool converts Hacker News threads into a structured text format. Enter a Hacker News post ID or URL in the input field, then click "Fetch and format" to retrieve the thread. The tool organizes comments in a hierarchical format with path numbers (like [1.2.3]) indicating the reply structure, making it easy to track conversation flow and export threads for reference elsewhere.
