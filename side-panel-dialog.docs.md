This page displays a product catalog with a side panel dialog system. When users click on a product, details appear in a side panel implemented using the HTML `<dialog>` element. The panel can operate in two modes: non-modal (allowing interaction with the main page) or modal (blocking interaction until closed). Users can also submit feedback about products through a form in the side panel.
