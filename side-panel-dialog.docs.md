The Side Panel Modal implementation uses the HTML `dialog` element to create a sliding panel UI. When a product is clicked, a side panel appears from the right edge showing product details and a feedback form. The system handles animations with CSS transitions and JavaScript, ensuring smooth opening/closing effects with proper backdrop handling. This approach combines semantic HTML with custom styling to create an accessible and visually pleasing interface.
