Prompts.js is a JavaScript library that provides modern alternatives to the browser's built-in alert, confirm, and prompt dialogs. The library offers an async/await syntax allowing for cleaner code when working with user interactions. Demonstrations on this page show how to trigger different types of dialogs, with the results displayed in a dedicated area below the buttons.
