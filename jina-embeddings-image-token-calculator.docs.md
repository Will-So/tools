The Image Token Calculator allows you to estimate the token cost for processing images with AI models. Upload an image by dragging and dropping it onto the designated area or by clicking to browse your files. After uploading, the calculator will display the image dimensions, number of tiles required to process the image, and the total token cost based on a calculation of 1000 tokens per tile.
