The Avatar Web Component allows users to select, crop, and resize profile images directly in the browser. Users can upload images by clicking, drag-and-drop, or pasting from clipboard, then precisely crop the image using the interactive resizing handles. The component automatically maintains the proper aspect ratio, generates a JPEG preview, and saves the resulting image data to a specified form field.
