This page allows you to generate human-like speech from text using OpenAI's GPT-4o audio models. Enter your prompts, select a model and voice, then generate audio output which can be played, downloaded, or shared via GitHub Gist. The interface displays both the audio player and a transcript of the spoken content, along with the complete API response for reference.
