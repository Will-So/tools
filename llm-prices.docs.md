This calculator allows you to estimate the cost of using various Large Language Models (LLMs) based on token counts. Enter your input and output token quantities, then either manually input pricing or select a model from the table to automatically populate the rates. The table displays current pricing for many popular LLMs and can be sorted by model name, input cost, or output cost.
